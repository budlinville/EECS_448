main.cpp line 33-36 - only 3 nodes are supposed to be added to the list at that point in the code. However, the code adds 4 instead
main.cpp line 40 - to insert into the middle of the linked list, an integer value of 3 should be passed in as a parameter as
  opposed to 2. This is because the the linked list implementation replaces the node at the given position and then pushes the node
  that was there (and all following nodes) back one position
LinkedList.cpp insertNode() - there is an issue with the way this method updates the value of listLength. Results are unexpected
  and potentially random
LinkedList.cpp removeNode() - none of the nodes in Steps 5,6 & 7 from main.cpp were removed. Rather the console prints out
  "Error: nothing was removed from the list" It must be an error in LinkedList.cpp and not main.cpp because all three removal
  conditions were tested - front, middle, back - and all failed
